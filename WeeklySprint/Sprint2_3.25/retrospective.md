During Sprint 1-2, we successfully implemented user authentication and created a stock pricing info platform using the Flask web framework. The user can register, log in, and log out, and their information is securely stored in the database. The platform allows the user to add cash, cash out, and view their portfolio of stocks, with real-time stock prices obtained using the Alpha Vantage API. We faced challenges with integrating the API and displaying the data in a user-friendly way, but with teamwork and persistence, we were able to overcome these obstacles. We also learned valuable lessons about database design and web application security. Overall, the Sprint 1-2 was a success, and we look forward to building on this foundation in the coming sprints.
