# Sprint6 Review

**Deployment Frequency:**

 &emsp; This sprint we mainly focused on recording our videoes for this project. Amy finished her part on historical buy and sell, and Qijun improved his database and updated some graphs in our project. 
 Most of our changes were made to the main branch, except some small details.

**Lead Time for Changes:**

 &emsp; At the beginning of this sprint, each member focused on creating and commiting their changes to their own branches, and during the later this week, after we have discussed what we have done, new release have been added. 

**Time to Restore Services:**

 &emsp; This sprint we did not encounter any issues.
 So, there was no need to spend time between the problematic release's install and the time we installed the release that fixed the issue.

**Change Failure Rate:**

 &emsp; This sprint there were no failures per the number of deployments. 
 So there is a 0% change failure rate.
