# Sprint 2 Review

**Deployment Frequency:**

 &emsp; This sprint we deployed successfully twice to gitlab.

**Lead Time for Changes:**

 &emsp; This sprint each time a new release is added, it took 1 day since the last commit that became part of the release.

**Time to Restore Services:**

 &emsp; This sprint we did not encounter any issues.
 So, there was no need to spend time between the problematic release's install and the time we installed the release that fixed the issue.

**Change Failure Rate:**

 &emsp; This sprint there were no failures per the number of deployments. 
 So there is a 0% change failure rate.
