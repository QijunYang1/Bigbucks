# Sprint 3 Review

**Deployment Frequency:**

 &emsp; This sprint we did not deploy to gitlab. Instead, we worked on our own branches and will deploy next week once our changes are confirmed and tested. We deployed our changes to our own branches and then deployed to gitlab.
 However, no changes were made to the main branch.

**Lead Time for Changes:**

 &emsp; This sprint each member focused on creating and commiting their changes to their own branches. Since each individual focused on releasing changes to their individual branches, there was about one day for a new release to be added, it took about one day since the last commit to became part of the individual release.

**Time to Restore Services:**

 &emsp; This sprint we did not encounter any issues.
 So, there was no need to spend time between the problematic release's install and the time we installed the release that fixed the issue.

**Change Failure Rate:**

 &emsp; This sprint there were no failures per the number of deployments. 
 So there is a 0% change failure rate.
