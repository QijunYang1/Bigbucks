During Sprint 3, we made significant progress in developing our stock pricing info platform. One major accomplishment was the implementation of storing the stock prices for the stocks in the S&P 500 list. This allowed us to provide more comprehensive and accurate pricing information to our users. The challenges here are we try to use differnt api to store the data, and the alphaventage api has limited number of requests each day, so we choose to use yahoo finance to store the data. 

We also added the ability for users to buy and sell stocks within the platform. This was a complex feature to implement, as we had to ensure that transactions were executed securely and accurately. However, with careful testing and collaboration between team members, we were able to successfully implement this functionality. The challenges here are we need to sttore each transactions into database and connenect to the user part. 

In addition, we added a new feature that allows administrators to view all user information. This was an important step in improving the platform's transparency and security. We also took steps to optimize the performance of the platform, such as improving the database schema and reducing unnecessary API calls. The challenges here are we initially set an username called "admin" and password in the code, and how could only give the admin authorization to view the user information. 

Finally, we added an efficient frontier graph to the platform. This was a valuable addition, as it provides users with a powerful tool for analyzing their portfolio and making informed investment decisions. The graph is based on data and protfolio it is hard to determine the graph is coorrect or not. 

Overall, we are pleased with the progress we made during Sprint 3. We overcame some significant technical challenges and added important features to the platform. We also continued to learn about database design, web application security, and collaborative development practices. We look forward to continuing to build on these achievements in the coming sprints.
